Health infrastructure is very well mapped, and stakeholders need to invest in OSM as a concrete source of community input/local knowledge into DRR decisions making. This is important framing for decision makers because this is community-generated data, this is where people will go for medical attention in disaster situations and and where people go for medicine.

var opts = {

  };

$(function() {
  gfdrr.generateMap('{{page.map}}', opts);
});
