The OpenStreetMap community is thriving. In Kathmandu, there are already 2,911km of roads (2,910,627 meters, 1,808 miles).
358km (358,118 meters, 223 miles) of these are small paths through crowded, hard to trace areas - the kind of data that is not only valuable in disaster situations, but also best when generated by the community who walk these paths everyday.
