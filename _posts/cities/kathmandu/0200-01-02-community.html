The OpenStreetMap community is thriving. Already there
2,911km of roads (2,910,627 meters, 1,808 miles)
358km (358,118 meters, 223 miles) of these are small paths through crowded, hard to trace areas - the kind of data that is not only valuable in disaster situations, but also best when generated by the community who walk these paths everyday.
