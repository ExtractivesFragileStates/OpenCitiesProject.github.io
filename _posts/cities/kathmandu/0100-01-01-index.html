The city of Kathmandu is the most important political, commercial, and industrial center in
Nepal and the biggest urban conglomerate. It lies in an oval shaped valley, which, legend
has it, used to be a lake in ancient times, leaving fertile soil behind for farming. This valley
has urbanized rapidly since the 1980’s; in the last decade alone it has grown from 1.6 million
inhabitants in 2001 to 2.5 million in 2011. Kathmandu is also the most at risk city in the world
in terms of potential death from earthquake, with major earthquakes historically occurring every
50 – 80 years. While the projections vary, if a Richter Scale 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck
Kathmandu Valley today as it did in 1934, approximately 250,000 people are expected to be
killed, 500,000 may require hospitalization, 50 percent of the population will be left homeless,
and 60 percent of all buildings will be heavily damaged.  Kathmandu needs smart urban planning
and strong community engagement to bring about urban resilience across the economic, physical,
social, and environmental sectors.
