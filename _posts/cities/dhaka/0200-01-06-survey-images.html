Although viewing buildings from above is useful, allowing users to see what the building looks like at ground level, helps them understand more of the picture.

<script>
var opts = {
  lat: 23.7910,
  lon: 90.3583,
  zoom: {
    defaultZoom:15,
    max:18,
    min:7
    }
  };

$(function() {
  gfdrr.generateMap('gfdrr.map-nkb1ordy,gfdrr.building-survey', opts);
});
</script>
