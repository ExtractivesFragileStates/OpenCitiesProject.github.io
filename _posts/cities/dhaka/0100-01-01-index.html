Colombo is Sri Lankaâ€™s biggest city, economic center, and major port.  It has been used by traders for over 2,000 years, growing into the multi-cultural, multi-ethnic city it is today. Each year, an increasing number of people move to Colombo, where the current population estimate is between 750,000 and 1 million inhabitants, up to 2 million when accounting for the surrounding metropolitan district. Much of this growth has been the unplanned proliferation of slums, lacking appropriate infrastructure and public utilities. Further, as a coastal city lying only 1.5 meters above sea level, Colombo is at high risk for floods and cyclones and the risk of these events is intensifying as climate change increases the volatility and frequency of severe weather. The challenges of urbanization and resilience facing Colombo grow with the city. Colombo needs to act now to achieve its vision of becoming a competitive, sustainable, and well-linked city, providing every family with a decent standard of living.
