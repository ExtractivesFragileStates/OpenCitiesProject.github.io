Using this neighborhood data it is possible to create a custom geocoder that would allow for neighborhood level search. This application could be used in the wake of a natural disaster to allow relief personal to understand where neighborhoods are located fast. The current neighborhood data in Colombo is poor and the addition of this set would help greatly.

<script>

var opts = {
  lat: {{ page.center[0].lat }},
  lon: {{ page.center[0].lon }},
  zoom: {
    defaultZoom:{{ page.center[0].zoom }},
    max:18,
    min:13
    }
  };

$(function() {
  gfdrr.generateMap('{{page.map}}', opts);
});
</script>
