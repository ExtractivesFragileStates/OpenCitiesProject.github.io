    <h2>Three Countries, Three Cities</h2>
    <p>Three cities -- Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and Colombo, the largest city in Sri Lanka -- are home to innovative proactive risk mitigation efforts, harnessing the power of strengthened institutions and empowered communities. Urban areas are exposed to unique vulnerabilities in responding to hazards and disasters. Through strengthened institutions, especially at the community level, effective proactive risk mitigation efforts contribute to building resilience to hazards, ensuring formal and informal institutions in place to respond in times of disasters are adequately resourced.</p>

    <p> Countries in South Asia, one of the most disaster prone regions of the world, must respond to and recover from complex environmental and natural disasters frequently. These risks pose serious, but not insurmountable challenges to sustainable development efforts.</p>
